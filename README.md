# Overview

The purpose of this project was to become familiar with developing web apps using Django. I chose Django since it handles many tasks automatically and can be easily used to make databases

This web app serves as a portfolio app for my art and programming projects. It is far from containing all of my projects, but it has enough to populate the page and allows more to be easily added.

* Art Gallery: Contains art viewer, the user can cycle through each image from database using arrow buttons
* Programming Project: Loads accordion menue with each project in the database, which contains a link to the GitHub repository and YouTube video demo
