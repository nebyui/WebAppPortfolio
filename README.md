# Overview

The purpose of this project was to become familiar with developing web apps using Django. I chose Django since it handles many tasks automatically and can be easily used to make databases

This web app serves as a portfolio app for my art and programming projects. It is far from containing all of my projects, but it has enough to populate the page and allows more to be easily added.
